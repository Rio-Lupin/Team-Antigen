# Team Antigen - Renal Cell Carcinoma Drug Discovery Platform

A web-based platform for accelerating drug discovery for **Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)**. This tool helps researchers and chemists explore and optimize drug candidates by providing interactive molecule visualization, R-group substitution capabilities, and real-time drug-likeness analysis.

## Purpose

In the chemical industry, synthesizing a single drug candidate takes **6 months and $100,000**, yet 99% of candidates fail in clinical trials. This platform focuses on drugs targeting proteins that drive **Renal Cell Carcinoma**, helping researchers:

- **Visualize** drug molecules interactively
- **Modify** molecules through R-group substitutions
- **Validate** drug candidates with real-time property calculations
- **Explore** relationships between proteins and their associated drugs

### Supported Proteins and Drugs

The platform currently includes drugs targeting:
- **VEGFR** (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor)
- **PDGFR** (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor)
- **mTOR** (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin)

Example drugs: Sunitinib, Cabozantinib, Everolimus, Temsirolimus

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Team-Antigen
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start the Flask server**
   ```bash
   python -m flask run
   # Or with custom host/port:
   python -m flask --app app run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5001
   ```

4. **Open in browser**
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   # Or http://localhost:5001 if using custom port
   ```

## How to Use

### 1. Search for Proteins

1. Type a protein name in the search field (e.g., "VEGFR", "PDGFR", "mTOR")
2. The platform will display all drugs associated with that protein
3. Each drug is shown as a card with its molecular structure (SVG visualization)

### 2. Explore Molecules

- **View molecule structure**: Each drug card displays an interactive SVG visualization
- **Clickable atoms**: Blue circles indicate modifiable atoms that can be substituted
- **Drug information**: Drug name and SMILES string are displayed below each molecule

### 3. Modify Molecules (R-group Substitution)

1. **Click on a clickable atom** (blue circle) in the molecule SVG
2. **Select an R-group** from the dropdown menu that appears:
   - Common options: Methyl, Fluorine, Chlorine, Hydroxyl, Amino, Phenyl, etc.
3. **Apply the substitution**: The molecule updates automatically with:
   - New molecular structure
   - Updated drug name (becomes "DrugName-test")
   - Updated SMILES string
   - Real-time property calculations

### 4. Analyze Drug Properties

The analytics panel on the right displays:

- **Drug-Likeness (QED)**: Quantitative estimate (0-1 scale, higher is better)
- **Ease of Synthesis (SAScore)**: Synthesis feasibility (1-10 scale, lower is better)
- **Lipinski's Rule of Five**: Oral drug-likeness checklist
  - Molecular Weight (MW ≤ 500 Da)
  - LogP (≤ 5)
  - Hydrogen Bond Donors (HBD ≤ 5)
  - Hydrogen Bond Acceptors (HBA ≤ 10)
- **Structural Alerts (PAINS)**: Identifies problematic substructures

### 5. Chain Modifications

- After modifying a molecule, clickable atoms remain active
- You can make multiple modifications in sequence
- Each modification updates properties in real-time

## Common Commands

```bash
# Install/update dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the development server
python -m flask run

# Start with custom host/port
python -m flask --app app run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5001

# Run CLI testing tool (optional)
python backend/test-1.py
```

## Scientific Background

### Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)

Renal Cell Carcinoma is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults. The platform focuses on targeting key proteins involved in RCC progression:

- **VEGFR/PDGFR**: Angiogenesis pathways
- **mTOR**: Cell growth and proliferation signaling

### Drug Properties Explained

- **QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness)**: Predicts how "drug-like" a molecule is based on multiple ADMET properties
- **SAScore (Synthetic Accessibility Score)**: Estimates how difficult/expensive a molecule is to synthesize
- **Lipinski's Rule of Five**: Classic guideline for oral drug candidates
- **PAINS**: Identifies substructures that cause false positives in assays
